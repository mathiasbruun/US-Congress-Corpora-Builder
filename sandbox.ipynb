       "' \\nThere can be no question that last \\nyear was a horrible year—as they have said in Britain, an ‘‘annus horribilis.’’ But as we begin the first year of this new decade, preparing to inaugurate a new President and inoculate the coun-try against this virus, the American people have reason to hope. \\nThe Senate can start off this new \\nyear by adding to that sense of hope by sending $2,000 checks to struggling American families. The Senate can start off 2021 by really helping the American people. We can start off 2021 by sending $2,000 checks to struggling American families to carry them through the darkest and final days of this pandemic. \\nThe votes today, on this uncommon \\nNew Year’s Day session, could be the last of the 116th Congress. That means \\nthat today is the last chance to take up and pass the House bill to provide $2,000 checks to the American people. If the Senate does not take action today, $2,000 checks will not become law be-fore the end of Congress, and they will know that Leader M\\nCCONNELL and the \\nRepublican majority have prevented them from getting the checks, plain and simple. \\nThis is the last chance—the last \\nchance for a mother in Nashville, $4,000 behind on the rent, whose water was shut off earlier this month. This is the last chance—the last chance for the medical receptionist in Macomb, $2,100 behind on the rent, whose electricity was shut off in September, on her son’s third day of virtual kindergarten. The kid can’t go to school. This is the last chance for 12 million Americans who have fallen nearly $6,000 behind on rent and utility or the 26 million Americans who have had trouble putting food on the table—the last chance. \\nMake no mistake about it, $600 has \\nnever been enough for them. This is the last chance to deliver $2,000 before a new Congress is sworn in and the legis-lative process must start all over again. \\nFor once, we have progressive Demo-\\ncrats, conservative Republicans, the President himself, and not to mention the majority—the vast majority—of the American people singing from the same songbook in support of these checks. We have a bill that has already passed the House. \\nAll we are asking for is a simple vote \\nin the Senate. I, for one, am confident it would pass if given the chance, and that may be the real reason that Lead-er M\\nCCONNELL and the Republicans \\ndon’t want to bring it up. We have had many opportunities this week to vote on the measure. Senator M\\nCCONNELL  \\nhas blocked every one of them. \\nWe have offered to vote on whatever \\nunrelated issues the Republican leader says he wants to vote on, so long as we can get a clean vote on the House bill to provide $2,000 checks—the only way to actually make it happen in this year, in this session of Congress. That offer still stands. That offer still stands. But give us a vote. Give us a vote on the House bill. \\nIt is OK if the Republican leader op-\\nposes checks. It is OK if the majority of Republican Senators oppose the checks. They can make their case to the American people and oppose the bill, but let us vote. It is OK if the Re-publican leader wants to call direct as-sistance to American people ‘‘poorly targeted’’ and ‘‘socialism for the rich,’’ even after he drove the passage of a $2 trillion across-the-board reduction in corporate taxes. But give us a vote. Make the argument. Let the Senate work its will. \\nTo me, it seems like the Republican \\nleader is afraid to schedule a vote on $2,000 checks because he is afraid it will pass. What a terrifying thought that struggling Americans would get some money to feed their families, pay the \\nrent, and get on with their lives; pay the utility bill of that kindergarten kid or third grade kid who can’t even go to school because his family can’t afford electricity. \\nWe have a chance—a chance at the \\nend of this painful year and at the be-ginning of a new one—to give Ameri-cans reason for hope in 2021. The only thing standing in the way right now is Leader M\\nCCONNELL and the Republican \\nSenate majority. \\nIn a moment, I will ask consent for \\nthe final time that the Senate set a time for a vote on the House bill to provide $2,000 checks. I have done it every day this week. This is it, the last chance for the 116th Congress to pass $2,000 checks and to say to regular Americans: ‘‘Help is on the way.’’ \\nLet’s have a vote. Let’s have a vote. \\nPass this bill. There is no better way to usher in the new year. \\nMr. President, I ask unanimous con-\\nsent that the Senate proceed to the im-mediate consideration of Calendar No. 645, H.R. 9051, a bill to increase recov-ery rebate amounts to $2,000 per indi-viduals; that the bill be read a third time and the Senate vote on passage; and if passed, that the motion to recon-sider be considered made and laid upon the table with no intervening action or debate. \\nThe PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there \\nobjection? \\nThe assistant majority leader. Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, reserving \\nthe right to object—and let me say, through the Chair, thank you to the Senator from New York and the Sen-ator from Vermont, the Senator from Illinois, and others here for the oppor-tunity to spend New Year’s with them. I know that has always been something that has been on my bucket list— maybe not on top of the bucket list. But, nevertheless, thank you for that opportunity. It does feel like a long time ago, but it was, actually, only—if you can believe this—the beginning of last week when both sides of the aisle and both sides of the Capitol came to-gether to pass a targeted, responsible, and necessary relief package, which be-came law with overwhelming bipar-tisan support. It passed here in the Senate 92 to 6. Members on both sides of the aisle, myself included, have dem-onstrated that we are willing to dedi-cate resources to those who are strug-gling during this pandemic. \\nThe problem with what is being put \\nforward—the House-passed CASH Act— is that it is not targeted to help those who are the most in need. I will just point out that it is not just our saying that; even the Washington Post edi-torial board called it ‘‘one last bad idea’’ for 2020. It singled out as ‘‘espe-cially wrongheaded’’ the efforts of the progressive left to depict this ‘‘as aid to ‘desperate’ Americans despite the huge amounts’’—this is the Wash-ington Post’s term—‘‘destined for per-fectly comfortable families.’’ \\nRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S7997 January 1, 2021 \\nAs others here on the floor have \\nnoted, the bill would provide a pay-ment to a family of five making up to $350,000. A family of five making $250,000 would receive a $5,000 benefit. Just to put that in perspective, that is more than was paid to a middle-class family of five under the CARES Act that we passed back in March. In addi-tion, the bill would add an additional $463 billion—nearly half a trillion dol-lars—to the annual debt. \\nAgain, it is all money we have to bor-\\nrow. All of this is money we have to borrow, and that is more than the first two economic impact payments com-bined. Put that in perspective, and think of other ways you could use that amount of money. The truth is that those types of sums could potentially be spent in many more targeted ways, but our colleagues on the Democratic side don’t even want to debate some of those alternatives. \\nAllowing small businesses a second \\ndraw from the Paycheck Protection Program would cost, approximately, $285 billion. For the cost of the CASH Act, we could do another round of as-sistance to help small businesses keep their employees on the payrolls and still have almost $200 billion left over. The expanded unemployment bene-fits—signed into law last week—will cost approximately $120 billion for 11 additional weeks. That means, for the same cost as this proposal, we could provide an additional 40 weeks—10 months—of enhanced unemployment insurance benefits to those who have lost their jobs. \\nThis is simply not targeted relief for \\nthe people who need it the most, and those who say that we should just vote on this flawed House bill conveniently leave out the fact that they do not want us to amend it to make it better in order to deliver more assistance to the people who are hurting the most. \\nAgain, I will just point out one last \\ntime that it has been less than a week, really, since the Senate voted and the President signed into law a proposal negotiated, literally, over months. Every fine point of that proposal was negotiated, and it was signed into law to provide targeted, fiscally respon-sible assistance to the people of this country who need it the most. This proposal is a shotgun approach, where a rifle makes a lot more sense. \\nIf you really want to help people who \\nneed this the most, at a time when we are running a $26 trillion debt and are borrowing every penny that we are making available to do this, we ought to sit down and figure out how to do it in the most efficient, effective, tar-geted way possible. This, absolutely, does not do that. When you have a fam-ily who is making $350,000 a year in this country getting up to thousands of dollars of payments and a family mak-ing $250,000 a year in this country get-ting, under this proposal, a $5,000 check, I would argue that it is not tar-geted, that it is not fiscally respon-sible, that it is not efficient, and that it is not an effective way to spend the \\nAmerican taxpayers’ dollars. \\nLet’s help the people who need it the \\nmost. We just passed and signed into law a proposal that does that. I think many of us on this side of the aisle are willing to look at other ideas and things that we could do that would help these people more, but this is cer-tainly not it, so I object. \\nThe PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-\\ntion is heard. \\nThe majority—excuse me. The Demo-\\ncratic leader. \\nMr. SCHUMER. Someday soon. (Laughter.) Mr. President, the only thing I would \\nsay, through the Chair, to my friend from South Dakota is that the many proposals he proposed as alternatives to our proposal are those to which the Republican majority objected when we had our negotiations on the CARES bill. We believe this can be in addition to the expansion of unemployment in-surance and other things. Given the state of the economy, that is what is needed. \\nI yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-\\nator from Vermont. \\nf \\nUNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST— \\nH.R. 9051 AND S. 5085 \\nMr. SANDERS. Mr. President, let me \\nsay to my friend, Senator T HUNE , that \\nI certainly concur with you as to what a pleasure it is to be spending New Year’s Day with you and our col-leagues. It is exactly what I, I know, and every other Member here wanted to do, but here we are because we have to be here. We are here because, back home in my State and all over this country, millions and millions of fami-lies are struggling to put food on the table. They are struggling to pay their rent. They are struggling to come up with the money they need to go to the doctor. \\nThis hits me, in a sense, in a personal \\nway. The other day, I received a letter from a colleague of mine in Burlington, VT, where I live—the largest city in the State of Vermont, all of 40,000 peo-ple. He wrote to me, reporting on a food drive in Burlington, VT, where I live: \\nOver 30 volunteers showed up to the Cham-\\nplain School to help bag groceries and to hand them out to those who came out. Un-fortunately, there was not nearly enough do-nated food to provide a bag to everyone who showed up despite us planning on an in-creased need. The line of cars filled the park-ing lot, wrapped around the school, and went out onto the main road for half a mile. This represented a major up-tick for the October event that we were involved in. \\nThis was in Burlington, VT, with \\nhundreds of cars lining up for emer-gency food and the volunteers not hav-ing enough food to distribute. They had to say to the families who were trying to feed their kids: Sorry. We do not have enough food. \\nSo what we are doing today is very \\nsimple, and that is that Senator T\\nHUNE , Senator M CCONNELL , and others \\nhave raised objection to the House- passed bill. In the U.S. Senate, when we have differences of opinion, what we should be doing is debating that bill. So all that Senator S\\nCHUMER is asking \\nand all that I am asking is simple: Bring the bill to the floor. We are not even asking you to vote for it. Bring the bill to the floor. On top of every-thing else, we need 60 votes to pass it— 60 votes. Can we get 60 votes? I don’t know. I think virtually all of the 48 Democrats will vote for it. \\nIt means, Senator T\\nHUNE , that we \\nneed 12 Republicans. I gather we have one right here who indicated he would vote for it, and five or six others have been public about saying they will vote for it. Will we get the rest? I don’t know. You don’t know. What is the problem with giving Members of the U.S. Senate the opportunity to vote on the legislation? When we have that de-bate, you can come up and raise all of your objections, and we can debate it. \\nNow, I heard Senator T\\nHUNE and Sen-\\nator M CCONNELL before him talk about \\nthis bill being socialism for the rich, which I have to tell you I find some-what hysterical because that is an issue I have been talking about for many, many years. I am very delighted that my conservative Republican friends now recognize that we do have socialism for the rich. To paraphrase Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., he said we live in a society where we have social-ism for the rich and rugged individ-ualism for the poor. King was right. \\nDespite what my Republican col-\\nleagues are saying, the truth is that, according to the Tax Policy Center, the top 5 percent of Americans—the wealthiest people in our country— would receive less than 1 percent of the benefits of these direct payments—less than 1 percent. It doesn’t sound, to me, like too much socialism for the rich. \\nWhile we are on the subject of social-\\nism for the rich, which my Republican friends have suddenly become very con-cerned about, let me talk about the Trump tax proposal that was pushed very hard by Senator M\\nCCONNELL and \\nthe Republican leadership and that, I think, every Republican voted for. Do you want to talk about socialism for the rich? It is not the bill that puts $2,000 into working-class hands all over this country. That isn’t socialism for the rich. This is socialism for the rich. In that bill, Amazon—oh, by the way, I must say this, if I may: We were quoting the liberal Washington Post, owned by Jeff Bezos—the wealthiest guy in the world. So here is Jeff Bezos’ company, Amazon, and they received a tax rebate. They paid nothing in 2018 in Federal taxes. That is a corrupt tax system to begin with, but then, on top of that, they received $129 million as a tax rebate. \\nThat, Senator T\\nHUNE , is socialism for \\nthe rich. In fact, this particular com-pany is owned by the richest guy in the world, and you gave him a $129 million rebate, but it is not just Amazon. \\nRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S7998 January 1, 2021 \\nDelta Air Lines also paid nothing in \\nFederal taxes in 2018; yet they received a $187 million rebate from that par-ticular bill. Chevron, in helping to de-stroy our planet with their carbon emissions, received $181 million in a re-bate. \\nThat, my friends, is what socialism \\nfor the rich is about. Socialism for the rich is not—in the midst of this ter-rible pandemic—putting $2,000 checks into the hands of working families. \\nThe truth of the matter is, as a result \\nof this pandemic, we are living through the worst and most difficult economic period since the Great Depression. Tens of millions of families are facing evic-tion all over this country—in the wealthiest Nation on Earth. Moms are struggling to feed their kids, keep the electricity on, and be able to go to the doctor. \\nNow, I hear from my Republican \\nfriends that the economy is doing bet-ter, but I would like to just read to them a few of the stories that I have received in my office. We asked people a simple question: How are you doing out there, and what is going on in your lives? We received many, many thou-sands of responses from people in every State in this country. I will read a few just to bring some dose of reality here to the U.S. Senate, which often, in the midst of all of the campaign contribu-tions coming in from the rich, does not know what is going on in the real world. \\nHere is the real world. A gentleman in Texas wrote: \\n$2,000 is the difference between keeping our \\napartment and being evicted. \\nA mother in Virginia wrote: \\n$2,000 means I can afford to feed my three \\nkids. \\nNow, maybe we should give her a \\nlong lecture on macroeconomics and how well the stock market is doing, but all she is worried about is feeding her three children. \\nA woman in Wisconsin wrote: \\n$2,000 would mean not having to choose be-\\ntween rent and groceries and not having to ration my partner’s meds. \\nA woman in Nevada wrote: \\n[It means] paying my rent and getting life-\\nsaving treatment because I can’t afford the $50 co-pay through my work insurance just to see my neurologist right now. \\nA father in Florida wrote: \\nIt would mean I could pay my bills. My \\nelectricity and phone are about to get shut off. I didn’t have money for my son on Christmas, and I won’t have money for his birthday on January 2. \\nA father in New Jersey wrote: \\nIt would mean I could pay off credit card \\ndebt accumulated during this pandemic, feed my children, and pay my bills. \\nA parent in Massachusetts wrote: \\nIt would mean that I could pay my rent \\nand electricity and put food on the table. \\nA woman in Missouri wrote: \\nIt would mean getting out of crushing \\ndebt. It would mean survival without daily fear. \\nSomeone in Texas wrote: It would mean I could actually put food in \\nthe fridge. \\nA man in Maryland wrote: \\nIt would mean I don’t have to beg or go \\nwithout food, shelter, and medicine. It would mean my family stays warm another couple of months and my dad gets proper treat-ment. \\nMr. DURBIN. Would the Senator \\nyield for a question? \\nMr. SANDERS. I would. Mr. DURBIN. I would like to ask a \\nquestion of the Senator from Vermont through the Chair. \\nI have listened to the Republican \\nanalysis of the bill, which you and Sen-ator S\\nCHUMER are asking for a vote on. \\nIt is a bill which passed the House and would give $2,000, basically, in allot-ments or payments to families across America, with certain income restric-tions. \\nAnd I have heard from the other side \\nof the aisle, repeatedly, that this is so-cialism for the rich, that this is fun-damentally unfair, and that we should do things in a targeted way. That is the argument that is made over and over again. \\nAnd reference has been made repeat-\\nedly to the COVID–19 bill that passed last week with 92 votes, including many of the Republicans—virtually all of them. Not all of them but virtually all of them. \\nAnd so that bill, if I remember cor-\\nrectly, had a $600 payment included in the bill, and I asked my staff: Would you please analyze the formula for dis-tributing the $600 and compare to it the formula for the $2,000, which is part of our bill. \\nAnd lo and behold, they discovered it \\nis the same formula. So if there is some fundamental, moral injustice in the distribution of these funds, then I am afraid all but six of the Republicans are guilty of the same immorality because they all voted for that formula last week when it was $600 and now are scandalized by the notion that the same formula they voted for would be used for a $2,000 payment. \\nI am sure I have missed something in \\nthe translation here. I would like to ask the Senator from Vermont to ex-plain this faux outrage from the Re-publican side of the aisle. \\nMr. SANDERS. Well, I think my \\nfriend from Illinois missed nothing in the translation. He is exactly right. \\nBut I also— Mr. THUNE. The Senator from Illi-\\nnois makes a good point. \\nWould the Senator yield for a ques-\\ntion? \\nMr. SANDERS. Yes. Mr. THUNE. So if the same formula \\nis used, and you are increasing the amount by $1,400 per person—so you are going from, basically, for a family of four, what would be a $2,400 payment to an $8,000 payment, and you phase that down using the same formula, does the Senator from Illinois under-stand the math and why that skews to-ward people who make a lot more money than they would under the other formula? Mr. DURBIN. If the question is di-\\nrected toward me, I will answer it. \\nMr. THUNE. Well, I just think that \\nyou are making a point in the state-ment which is not accurate because you are saying the formula is the same. The formula is the same, but the in-puts change, and so the way it ramps down means that somebody who makes $350,000 gets a payment under the Sanders-Hawley proposal that they wouldn’t—but they wouldn’t—no, and it phases out a lot sooner, as you know. \\nSo let’s be clear about how that for-\\nmula works. You are misrepresenting the way that formula works. \\nThe PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-\\nator from Vermont has the floor. \\nMr. SANDERS. Thank you very \\nmuch, Mr. President. \\nI would ask my friend from South \\nDakota: Do you disagree with the Tax Policy Center, which says that the top 5 percent of Americans—the wealthiest people in our country—would receive less than 1 percent of the total benefits being disbursed? \\nMr. THUNE. I have not seen the Tax \\nPolicy Center, but I know math, and I know as a basic principle that when you stick bigger numbers in there and you are using the same formula to phase something out, you are going to make it available to people who make a lot more money. That is a mathe-matical fact. \\nAnd what you are saying, when you \\ntalk about the same formula, it skews entirely different in the income scale, and you know that. \\nAnd all I am saying is don’t mis-\\nrepresent the facts. \\nMr. SANDERS. And all that I am \\nsaying is that, according to a very rep-utable tax center organization—people who do this for a living—less than 1 percent of the benefits of the entire program go to the wealthiest people in this country. \\nSo when you are talking about trying \\nto say: Oh my God, all of this money is going to the rich, that ain’t really true. \\nBut I would also ask my friend: When \\ndid you suddenly become a religious adherent about concerns of socialism for the rich, when you gave 83 percent of the benefits for the rich and large corporations in the tax bill that you supported? Where was your concern about socialism for the rich when Ama-zon—owned by the richest guy in the world—got a $129 million tax rebate? I didn’t hear much about socialism for the rich during that debate. \\nMr. THUNE. Will the Senator from \\nVermont allow me to respond to that question? \\nMr. SANDERS. Yes. Mr. THUNE. Well, very simply, what \\nyou are suggesting—what you are say-ing here is that the owner of the Wash-ington Post, who said this is really bad policy and shouldn’t be done in this way at the end of this year—is that what you are saying? That because he is a wealthy person, that somehow that is why he is making that statement? \\nRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S7999 January 1, 2021 \\nMr. SANDERS. The wealthiest in the \\nworld. \\nMr. THUNE. I think the Washington \\nPost editorial board, in most cases, has been very sympathetic to the argument of the Senator from Vermont. \\nMr. SANDERS. That is factually in-\\naccurate. \\nMr. THUNE. In fact, they take a lib-\\neral point of view on almost every issue. \\nMy point, very simply, is that we \\nhave a limited amount of resources. This is borrowed money, as the Senator from Vermont knows. And when we spent months—literally months—and you ask: Why can’t you guys just come down here, why can’t you just come down here and debate this, we tried for months to get the Democrats down here to debate a bill. We put a bill on the floor in September, we put a bill on the floor in October, a coronavirus re-lief bill, and you guys blocked it. You didn’t even want to talk about it. You didn’t want to have an opportunity to amend it. \\nWe have been working at this for \\nmonths, and we finally arrived, after months, at a proposal that helps people who need it the most, including nutri-tion assistance, including rental assist-ance, and including checks to people— \\nMr. SANDERS. Reclaiming my time. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-\\nator from Vermont. \\nMr. SANDERS. All that I am say-\\ning—all that I am saying—this is a great debate, John. We should have this debate, and in 2 minutes—in 2 min-utes, John, I am going to give you the opportunity to say you support what we are doing, and then we will have this debate. That is your opportunity. \\nBut I want to get back—the Senator \\nfrom South Dakota did not answer the question that it was not, apparently, a huge concern about socialism for the rich in the bill that they supported or worried about the debt that would incur. \\nSo I see, if I may say so, a bit of hy-\\npocrisy here. Senator T\\nHUNE and the \\nRepublican leadership want to debate this issue, and so do I. I think it is a great debate—great debate. \\nNow, as everybody knows, Senator \\nM\\nCCONNELL proposed an idea. I don’t \\nagree with it, but it is an idea that is worthy of debate and discussion, and he said: Let’s combine three elements together. Let’s incorporate the bill passed in the House by two-thirds of the House, including 44 Republicans; let’s add to that the repeal of section 230 of the Telecommunications Act; and let’s also add to that, at President Trump’s request, an issue about voter integrity, et cetera, et cetera. \\nOK. That is what Senator M\\nCCON-\\nNELL proposed. \\nAnd in one moment, I am going to \\nbring—because I know Republicans think I don’t do much for them and I am not concerned about them—but, Senator T\\nHUNE , I am going to bring \\nyour bill to the floor. Show you what a nice guy I am. New year, I am going to bring Senator M\\nCCONNELL ’s bill right \\nto the floor and give you an oppor-tunity to vote for it. \\nAll that I am asking, while I bring \\nSenator M\\nCCONNELL ’s Republican bill \\nto the floor, we are going to bring the bill that passed the House, with 44 Re-publicans, to the floor as well. \\nWe will have two votes: One vote on \\nSenator M\\nCCONNELL ’s bill, which needs \\n60 votes to pass; one vote on the House bill, 60 votes to pass. That is it. \\nSo it is hard for me to imagine how \\nSenator T\\nHUNE will object to us bring-\\ning forward the Republican bill. \\nHere it goes. This is the legalese that \\nI need to say and I am going to bring it forth and I am sure that Senator T\\nHUNE will support me in my effort. \\nMr. President, I ask unanimous con-\\nsent that if cloture is invoked on the veto message on H.R. 6395, National Defense Authorization Act, that not-withstanding rule XXII, at 3 p.m. today—short period of time—3 p.m. today, Friday, January 1, the Senate proceed to the consideration of Cal-endar No. 645, H.R. 9051, to provide a $2,000 direct payment to the working class; that the bill be considered read a third time and the Senate vote on pas-sage of the bill; and that if passed, the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table; further, that following the vote on H.R. 9051, the Senate proceed to the consider-ation of Calendar No. 644, S. 5085; that the bill be considered read a third time; that there be 1 hour of debate on the bill, equally divided and controlled by myself or my designee and Senator M\\nCCONNELL or his designee; that fol-\\nlowing the use or yielding back of that time, the Senate vote on passage of the bill; and that if passed, the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table, all without intervening action or debate. \\nThe PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there \\nobjection? \\nMr. HAWLEY. Mr. President, reserv-\\ning the right to object. \\nThe PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-\\nator from Missouri. \\nMr. HAWLEY. Mr. President, I want \\nto say that I can’t, for the life of me, figure out why it is so difficult to get a vote on the bills that Senator S\\nAND-\\nERShas just referenced, when, by my \\ncount, the President of the United States, the Speaker of the House, a large majority of the House of Rep-resentatives, and I think a super-majority of this body are all in favor— all in favor—of $2,000 COVID relief pay-ments to working Americans. \\nNow, we have had some back-and- \\nforth on the floor today about how we got to the level of $2,000. We all know how we got to that level. The President of the United States said that is the level he supported. The number origi-nates with him. This is the number that he has asked for and the House adopted it and a majority of Senators \\nhave said already publicly that they support it. \\nAnd yet we can’t seem to even get a \\nvote on it. We can’t even seem to have debate on it. I mean, with all due respect, this \\ndoesn’t seem, to me, to be a Repub-licans versus Democrats issue; this seems to be the Senate versus the United States of America and I just don’t understand it and I am willing to bet—I am willing to bet that the Amer-ican people don’t understand it either. \\nI mean, here we are, in the throes of \\nthe worst pandemic in a century, that working people have borne the brunt of, and all that we are asking is that those working people be first in line for relief and that they be given meaning-ful relief that is only approximately commensurate with the hardships that they and their families have borne. \\nNow, I hear a lot of talk about how \\nwe can’t afford it. I do notice, however, that we seem to be able to afford all kinds of other stuff. We can afford to send lots of money to other govern-ments. We can afford to send all kinds of tax breaks and bailouts to big cor-porations. We can afford to spend enor-mous sums of money on pork—hun-dreds of billions of dollars in that last bill on pork—hundreds of billions. But we can’t seem to find the money for re-lief for working people that the Presi-dent and the House and the Senate all support, and yet we can’t seem to get it onto the floor. \\nLet me just share three stories that I \\nhave heard just this week alone—this week alone—from my home State, from Missouri. \\nDanielle, from St. Louis County, \\ncalled my office. She said her utilities are about to be shut off. She is des-perate for help. She said a $2,000 pay-ment would go a long way to help keep the lights on and her house warm. \\nI heard from a mother in Southeast \\nMissouri. That is the bootheel of my State. She wrote that her son had lost pay because of his company’s cutting back hours because of COVID and that he himself had contracted the virus and so he had to be home and he was missing work, missing shifts. His fam-ily can’t make it paycheck to pay-check. Her daughter-in-law is donating plasma in order to help earn some extra grocery money—donating plasma in order to get some money to pay for groceries to feed their family. \\nRichard from St. Louis wrote to me \\nand said any extra help that he could get would go directly to paying his rent and his utilities. He had a job that he lost, in the retail business, the re-tail sector, and he is desperately strug-gling. \\nI would state to the Presiding Officer \\nthat these people are not ne’er-do- wells. These are working people. These are strong people. These are proud peo-ple. And all they ask for, as I have said many times on this floor before, is a chance to get back on their feet and to be able to provide for their families. And I can’t for the life of me under-stand why we cannot get so much as a vote on these bills. \\nFor that reason, Mr. President, I do \\nnot object. In fact, I enthusiastically support the measures that Senator \\nRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S8000 January 1, 2021 \\nSANDERS is trying to bring to the floor, \\nand I would vote for both if we were given the opportunity. \\nThe PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there \\nobjection? \\nThe Senator from Texas. Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, reserv-\\ning the right to object, I know Senator T\\nOOMEY is delayed coming to the floor, \\nand on his behalf, I will object. \\nThe PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-\\ntion is heard. \\nf \\nCONCLUSION OF MORNING \\nBUSINESS \\nThe PRESIDING OFFICER. Morning \\nbusiness is closed. \\nf \\nLEGISLATIVE SESSION \\nWILLIAM M. (MAC) THORNBERRY \\nNATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZA-TION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2021—VETO—Resumed \\nThe PRESIDING OFFICER. Under \\nthe previous order, the Senate will re-sume consideration of the veto message on H.R. 6395, which the clerk will re-port. \\nThe senior assistant legislative clerk \\nread as follows: \\nVeto message, a bill (H.R. 6395) to author-\\nize appropriations for fiscal year 2021 for military activities of the Department of De-fense, for military construction, and for de-fense activities of the Department of Energy, to prescribe military personnel strengths for such fiscal year, and for other purposes. \\nThe PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-\\nator from Oklahoma. \\nMr. INHOFE. Mr. President, these \\nare the last few words that Senator R\\nEED and I will say before the vote, \\nand I want to mention something that I haven’t talked about as much as I probably should have. \\nFirst of all, the cooperation and \\nworking with Senator R\\nEED and his \\nstaff—this is a long enduring thing. It is hard for people to believe, but we are actually starting on next year’s bill now. We have already started. \\nI thought I would mention something \\nthat hasn’t been talked about as much as it should have been talked about since we have suffered arguably the worst cyber attack in American his-tory. This is the most significant piece of cyber legislation in American his-tory. It contains 27 of our Cyberspace Solarium Commission recommenda-tions. All 27 are in this NDAA, to in-clude provisions that are directly rel-evant to the SolarWinds attack that would have allowed us to get ahead of this—most notably by allowing deci-sive cyber security measures in DHS to begin hunting for threats on dot-gov networks. \\nWe have other recommendations to \\nenhance our cyber resilience for our nuclear command and control systems in this NDAA. Establishing a national cyber director is in the NDAA, strengthening the size and elevating his leadership, giving him more re-\\nsources. I fear that the SolarWinds at-tack is a harbinger of things to come. I am very proud of the work our Com-mission has done, and the provisions are absolutely critical. \\nThe final thing I would say is that \\nthis is arguably the most serious piece of legislation when it comes to deter-ring China that we have had in dec-ades, if not ever, including provisions such as the Pacific Deterrence Initia-tive. This is kind of a followup to last year’s European Deterrence Initiative, where we are concentrating more on Russia, but this is specific to China. \\nThat is what the whole division of \\nthis bill is about—to enhance our pres-ence and our deterrence posture in the INDOPACOM provisions for protecting against Chinese industrial espionage, more transparency for Chinese mili-tary companies, reporting on Chinese United Front Work Department in the United States and abroad, and the list goes on and on. It is a very serious piece of legislation when it comes to deterring China. That is one of the things we are concerned about. China is our No. 1 threat and will be for per-haps, regrettably, decades to come. So this bill brings us along to where we should be. \\nOnce again, I want to say thanks for \\nthe effort that has gone into this bill, the weekends, the hard work. L\\nIZCHE-\\nNEY and John Bonsell, I have to say, \\nalong with J ACK REED—they probably \\nworked more weekends than they have not worked weekends. So it has been a real effort. \\nIt is the most important and signifi-\\ncant piece of legislation that we will pass, and this next vote is a very crit-ical vote. \\nI will yield to Senator R\\nEEDfor any \\ncomments he would like to make about this. Keep in mind that this is a real— people talk about how the Democrats and Republicans don’t do things to-gether. This has been an example of what can happen in government. \\nThe PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-\\nator from Rhode Island. \\nMr. REED. Mr. President, let me first \\nbegin by commending the chairman for his extraordinary efforts. He led this process, let there be no mistake about it. He rose to the challenges. This is the most challenging NDAA for so many different reasons—because of the pandemic, the need for social distancing in terms of hearings, the whole scope of challenges that have arisen in the past few months—and the chairman has done a remarkable job. \\nLet me start by saying that this is \\nessential for our national security. This bill is not optional. If we want to continue to maintain our security for the United States, we have to pass this legislation. It is that simple. \\nWhat does it do? Well, it does things \\nthat we have to do every year. One, it provides for the support of our service men and women. I know we are all celebrating New Year’s Day here. It is kind of disconcerting to be working when everyone else is partying, but if \\nyou feel a little bit put upon, think about the soldiers in forward operating bases in Afghanistan who are facing danger. Think about the ballistic sub-mariners protecting the United States. Think about the airmen who flew the B–52 bombers. Think about them and their families, and I think you will ap-preciate more what they do every day and what we do once in a while. \\nOne of the issues that the chairman \\nspoke about is how cyber security is es-sential. We based our efforts on an in-sightful report by the Cyber Solarium Commission, headed by Senator A\\nNGUS  \\nKINGand Congressman M IKEGALLA -\\nGHER . \\nEvery day, we are learning more \\nabout the Russian penetration of our whole national security apparatus and civilian companies. Just today, Micro-soft announced that they have been deeply penetrated by the Russian in-trusion, and I suspect it is very serious. \\nThis legislation was done, remark-\\nably, before we knew of such an intru-sion and responds specifically to this type of cyber breach on the United States. It gives the Department of Homeland Security the authority to audit other agencies in terms of their cyber security and take other steps to hunt for threats. It is just the first step, but if we don’t take this step, we will be further behind. \\nNow, the other thing I want to point \\nout, too, is echoing what the chairman said about the Pacific Deterrence Ini-tiative. We have identified $2 billion that can be used—and we will focus upon how it is used—to create a new strategy. This is really the first time that we have stepped back and said: Let’s set up a strategic posture that recognizes the true threats that China is now presenting to us in the Pacific. This is the first time we have done this. \\nWhat it does is it builds on our close \\nrelationships with key allies—Aus-tralia, Japan, South Korea. It does that by a series of steps—first, through command post exercises where we test our communications; second, real exer-cises. With these steps, we are building to a point where large-scale joint exer-cises involving not only our key allies but other partners become possible. That will set us up for the ability to deter China. When they see all of the nations of the Pacific that have worked with us closely and that are prepared to work with us, that will be a great deterrence. That is the goal of this ef-fort. So any suggestion that China is happy about this bill is completely baseless. \\nThen finally, again, like the chair-\\nman, I must thank the staff, John Bonsell and Elizabeth King and the staff and all the Members. Again, my congratulations to the chairman for his great work. \\nI urge passage. Again, I think this is \\nessential. As I said before, there are thousands of soldiers, sailors, airmen, marines, and coastguardsmen who are \\nRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S8001 January 1, 2021 \\non the watch as we speak. It is our ob-\\nligation to them to give them the tools they need to protect us. \\nI yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-\\nator from Oklahoma. \\nMr. INHOFE. I suggest that this is \\nthe most significant bill we have passed in the last 59 years. \\nMr. President, I would ask unani-\\nmous consent that the mandatory quorum call be waived with respect to the motion to invoke cloture on the veto message on H.R. 6395, the NDAA. \\nThe PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there \\nobjection? \\nWithout objection, it is so ordered. \\nCLOTURE MOTION  \\nThe PRESIDING OFFICER. Pursuant \\nto rule XXII, the Chair lays before the Senate the pending cloture motion, which the clerk will state. \\nThe senior assistant legislative clerk \\nread as follows: \\nCLOTURE MOTION  \\nWe, the undersigned Senators, in accord-\\nance with the provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, do hereby move to bring to a close debate on the veto message on H.R. 6395, a bill to authorize ap-propriations for fiscal year 2021 for military activities of the Department of Defense, for military construction, and for defense activi-ties of the Department of Energy to pre-scribe military personnel strengths for such fiscal year, and for other purposes. \\nMitch McConnell, James M.

By unan-\\nimous consent, the mandatory quorum call has been waived. \\nThe question is, Is it the sense of the \\nSenate that debate on the veto mes-sage on H.R. 6395, a bill to authorize appropriations for fiscal year 2021 for military activities of the Department of Defense, for military construction, and for defense activities of the De-partment of Energy, to prescribe mili-tary personnel strengths for such fiscal year, and for other purposes, shall be brought to a close? \\nThe yeas and nays are mandatory \\nunder the rule. \\nThe clerk will call the roll.

The Sen-\\nator from Oklahoma. \\nMr. INHOFE. Mr. President, we are \\ngoing to go on to final passage, and I just want to make one comment that this is a really significant vote, not just because it is the NDAA and many of us contend, as I do, every year that the NDAA is the most significant vote that we have, but this year especially so in light of all the disruptions and problems that we have had. \\nOnce again, I want to say how great \\nit has been to work and show the American people that Democrats and Republicans can work together and get significant legislation passed. I am very proud that we had this bill, and I am proud to have worked with Senator R\\nEEDand his staff. \\nThe PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-\\nator from Rhode Island. \\nMr. REED. Mr. President, this legis-\\nlation is central to the national secu-rity of the United States and to the welfare of the troops and their families who defend us every day. \\nI would urge all my colleagues to \\nvote to override the veto. \\nI want to thank Senator I\\nNHOFE for \\nhis leadership and congratulate John Bonsell on the Republican side and Liz King on the Democratic side. \\nAgain, I urge all of my colleagues to \\nvote for this bill. \\nI yield the floor.

Mr. President, I ask \\nconsent that the veto message on S. 906, the Driftnet Modernization and By-catch Reduction Act, be considered as \\n I signed an Executive Order on Promoting American Seafood Competitiveness and Economic Growth to bolster our do-mestic seafood industry while curbing illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing abroad. On June 5, 2020, I issued a Proclamation on Modifying the Northeast Canyons and Seamounts Ma-rine National Monument to open it to commercial fishing that is conducted in accordance with the Magnuson-Ste-vens Act and other applicable laws, regulations, and requirements. And as fishermen struggled to stay on the water during the pandemic, I issued a Memorandum on Protecting the United States Lobster Industry and later made \\napproximately $530 million available, through the U.S. Department of Agri-culture’s Seafood Trade Relief Pro-gram, to support the United States sea-food industry and fishermen affected by retaliatory tariffs from foreign gov-ernments. \\nMy Administration would support \\nprovisions of the enrolled bill, if passed separately, which would authorize fee collection in a different fishery—the Pacific Halibut fishery. This authority is needed to implement a provision of the International Pacific Halibut Com-mission Convention, to which the United States is a party. However, for the sake of American fishermen na-tionwide, I will not let the Congress circumvent the fisheries management process by effectively terminating a fishery without appropriate consulta-tion and input from fishery manage-ment councils. If this occurred, it would increase our reliance on im-ported seafood and take away the live-lihoods of hard-working Americans and their family businesses. It is my duty to return S. 906 to the Senate without my approval. \\nD\\nONALD J. T RUMP .\\nTHEWHITE HOUSE , January 1, 2021. \\nf \\nMORNING BUSINESS \\nMr. BOOZMAN. Mr. President, I ask \\nunanimous consent that the Senate be in a period of morning business, with Senators permitted to speak therein for up to 10 minutes each. \\nThe PRESIDING OFFICER. Without \\nobjection, it is so ordered. \\nf \\nNATIONAL DEFENSE \\nAUTHORIZATION ACT \\nMr. PAUL. Mr. President, the time \\nhas come to declare victory and come home from the war in Afghanistan—the longest war in the history of our coun-try. \\nOver 4,000 Americans have died fight-\\ning in Afghanistan, and over 20,000 have been wounded. It is time to bring our soldiers home. \\nAfter the 9/11 attacks, I supported \\ngoing into Afghanistan. We were abso-lutely justified in rooting out the Taliban who harbored al-Qaida. \\nHad I been in Congress at that time, \\nI would have voted in favor of going into Afghanistan. \\nBut the people who attacked us on 9/ \\n11 have all been killed or captured. They are long gone. But we are still there. \\nMost of the people fighting us in Af-\\nghanistan today are the successors or children or the children of their chil-dren. \\nThe cycle shows no sign of ending. \\nThe war shows no sign of ending. It is not sustainable to keep fighting in Af-ghanistan generation after generation. \\nHere is some perspective: We have \\nbeen fighting in Afghanistan for so long that when the 9/11 attacks hap-pened, our youngest soldiers fighting there today weren’t even born yet. \\nAmerican fathers who fought in Af-ghanistan are now watching as their sons fight in Afghanistan. \\nWe have spent about $1 trillion to es-\\ntablish an Afghan government—a gov-ernment that is rife with corruption and dysfunction. It is a government that cannot perform much of any gov-ernment function on its own. So we spend more to do for them what they still cannot do for themselves. \\nA trillion dollars and we have hardly \\nprogressed from where we started. \\nYet instead of outrage—which is how \\nmost Americans feel—the reaction from Congress is, gosh, maybe let’s spend a trillion more. \\nAfter World War II, much of Europe \\nwas reduced to rubble. It was utterly destroyed. So we rebuilt Europe through the Marshall Plan. \\nWe have now spent many times more \\nto rebuild Afghanistan than we did under the Marshall Plan. What has that money gotten us? \\nWe have built infrastructure in Af-\\nghanistan and then watched it deterio-rate and watched the Afghans be un-able to even maintain the infrastruc-ture we built for them, and then they ask us for more money to maintain the structure. So we rebuild the infrastruc-ture we just built for them. \\nMeanwhile, our roads and our bridges \\nhere at home crumble as we spend mil-lions upon millions to rebuild the in-frastructure in Afghanistan. \\nI want to walk through some exam-\\nples of how our money has been used in Afghanistan. \\nSeveral years ago, we reportedly \\nhired a local security consultant to help secure road construction projects, at a cost of $1 million per year. But ac-cording to the report by the Special In-spector General for Afghanistan Recon-struction, American officials came to suspect that the money was being fun-neled to insurgents to stage attacks on our infrastructure, which could be used to justify the security contract. \\nSo our money was going to a guy who \\nwas apparently paying insurgents to stage attacks against him so he could justify his security contract. It is crazy. \\nWe spent $43 million on a natural \\ngas, gas station. Guess how many vehi-cles in Afghanistan run on natural gas. Zero. You can’t even find the gas sta-tion. My staff actually went there to see how the money had been spent, and they were told they couldn’t go there because it was too unsafe. Now the re-port is that the gas station has been abandoned—and with it $43 million flushed away. \\nWe spent nearly $80 million on a lux-\\nury hotel. Why is the American tax-payer building luxury hotels in Kabul? Guess what. It was abandoned halfway through. It is a skeleton. The Taliban are now said to climb up into the struc-ture and shoot down at our Embassy. \\nWe spent about $400 million on equip-\\nment and other things to create an Af-ghan Army Corps of Engineers. Except \\nRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S8003 January 1, 2021 \\nall the equipment we bought was lost. \\nGone. \\nWe spent hundreds of millions on \\nelectrification projects in Afghanistan, but the system wasn’t working. Af-ghans didn’t understand that you had to pay for electricity and that you couldn’t climb up utility poles. So, we spent almost $2 million on a public awareness campaign to tell Afghans that they did, in fact, have to pay for electricity and to please stop climbing on the electrical wires. \\nThere was a multimillion-dollar \\nhighway project that also required $32 million in community outreach. This is basically an attempt to help locals un-derstand what is happening, since they have no experience with a giant high-way or what it is for. \\nThe Special Inspector General for Af-\\nghanistan Reconstruction examined this ‘‘community outreach’’ and found that one Regional Coordinator was given cash—$75,000—to help with out-reach with locals, but SIGAR found that they could not account for the $75,000 which had been filed as used for ‘‘goat distribution.’’ Now, I don’t know a lot about goats, but that seems like a lot of ‘‘goat’’ money. \\nThe guy giving out the goat money \\nmysteriously disappeared. The inspec-tor general reports that the money is unrecoverable. \\nMy subcommittee held an oversight \\nhearing on Afghan war spending, and Ambassador Boucher, one of the wit-nesses, recounted that the Afghan Fi-nance Minister told him 80 to 90 per-cent of the money Congress approves disappears before it gets to Afghani-stan. It is not just corruption. He said: You know, we hire a contractor who hires a subcontractor, who hires a bunch of consultants, who hires a bunch of security personnel, who flies in airplanes, etc. And by the time you get somebody on the ground in Afghan-istan receiving a benefit, it is a very small portion of all those billions and billions of dollars that Congress allo-cated for whatever that purpose was. \\nWe continue to pour good money \\nafter bad into Afghanistan, hoping that the outcome will somehow change, hoping that maybe the next 20 years will produce better results than the last 20 years did. \\nThe American people say ‘‘Come \\nhome,’’ and now is the time. A Pew poll from last year found that 59 percent of Americans—and 58 percent of vet-erans—thought the Afghanistan war has not been worth fighting. One poll from this year shows far more Ameri-cans support withdrawal from Afghani-stan than support continuing the war, and almost three-quarters of veterans support ending the war. \\nWe should be listening to those who \\nhave been on the ground in Afghani-stan. There are so many veterans who have witnessed firsthand the rudderless direction of the war. \\nWe should listen to Army combat \\nmedic Shane Reynolds, who served in Iraq: ‘‘For all of us that went over there and worked so hard, and put our \\nfamilies through so much, and there was never a strategy. We were just going through motions, chasing ghosts through mountains . . . We felt that there was no plan, there was no strat-egy and there was no will to change anything about that.’’ \\nMaybe the Senate should listen to In-\\nfantryman Jay O’Brien, who served in Kandahar: \\n‘‘Now I realize that no one above us \\nknew what the hell was going on ei-ther. It’s systemic willful ignorance all the way up to the top.’’ \\nArmy Intelligence Officer Gregg \\nFrostrom, who served four deploy-ments overseas over an 11-year period, captures the perspective of those who served: \\n‘‘There’s a lot of feeling like you’re \\nSisyphus, like you’re just pushing the rock up the hill, and you go home for six months, and you come back and the rock’s at the bottom of the hill and you’re like, well, now I’ve got to start pushing it again.’’ \\nPresident Trump ran for the Presi-\\ndent promising to end these forever wars. The American people want to end the Afghanistan war. Yet the establish-ment powers in Washington and Con-gress have fought him at every turn. \\nThis bill explicitly tries to tie the \\nhands of all Presidents and make it dif-ficult if not impossible to declare vic-tory and come home. \\nNot only does this bill make it hard-\\ner for any President to end a war, we already have high-ranking officials of our government directly defying the President’s orders to deescalate war. \\nTake Syria for example. President \\nTrump ordered troop levels to decline from around 2,000 to approximately 200. Former Ambassador Jim Jeffrey not only defied this order, he lampooned it later by saying, ‘‘What Syria with-drawal? There was never a Syria with-drawal.’’ \\nAccording to Defense One, ‘‘outgoing \\nAmbassador Jim Jeffrey, the U.S. spe-cial envoy for Syria acknowledges that he routinely misled senior leaders about troop levels in Syria.’’ \\nJeffrey’s admitted to ‘‘playing shell \\ngames’’ to obscure from the President and his generals how many troops were really left in Syria. In reality, Trump’s order to reduce the troops was counter-manded by an unelected bureaucrat. \\nAs Becket Adams explains, ‘‘Obscure \\nfederal workers have reportedly been in control of the U.S. military presence in northern Syria, and all in direct viola-tion of explicit orders from the Presi-dent.’’ \\nAdams continues: ‘‘Nothing to worry \\nabout here, folks. Just some nameless federal drones allegedly misleading the commander of the U.S. military in order to keep troops stationed overseas in conflicts that said drones believe are necessary and winnable. People laugh when they hear the term ‘‘deep state,’’ but it is no joke.’’ \\nPresident Trump has ordered troop \\nlevels to be reduced in Afghanistan, so Congress responded by passing an \\nNDAA which actually restricts his ability to withdraw troops. \\nThat is right. Congress, which has \\nspent decades lecturing any and every one that we don’t need 535 generals and that there is only one Commander in Chief who has absolute powers to wage war however he sees fit, has now re-versed course and decided that we actu-ally do need 535 generals in order to stop the Commander in Chief from withdrawing troops from Afghanistan. \\nPresident Trump vetoed that NDAA, \\nand now we are here today in an at-tempt to override that veto, to add a 20th year to this war. \\nThis is a mistake. But Congress has \\nhad it wrong for a long time, so this is nothing new. They just passed a $1.4 trillion omnibus bill that no one saw until hours before it was to be voted on, and they paired it with a $900 bil-lion coronavirus bailout, paid for with money borrowed from our children. \\nWe are told all the time that there is \\nsimply no more fat left to cut in the budget, that we have to borrow because we can’t cut our high priorities. What are those high priorities, you may ask? Let’s start with a look at this bill that just passed. \\nThere is $25 million for Pakistan in \\nthere. Pakistan puts Christians on death row when they are accused of blasphemy, except that allegations of blasphemy are often based on petty dis-putes among neighbors or coworkers. There are reportedly 80 people on death row in Pakistan for blasphemy-related charges. \\nThere is $700 million for Sudan in the \\nbill, where freedom of expression is re-stricted. \\nThere is another $500 million to ad-\\ndress the root causes of migration from Central America. I doubt the report mentions the allure of all the free stuff you can get after you break in to America. \\nHow about $575 million for ‘‘family \\nplanning’’ in the third world? \\nHow many businesses, struggling to \\nmake payroll because their Governor closed them down, could have used that $575 million? \\nCongress is borrowing a trillion dol-\\nlars a year so that they can keep spending money on these kinds of things. They don’t want to set prior-ities. \\nThis is hardly new. I have been \\nwatching this for years and called out the big spenders in Congress for ap-proving: $250,000 to send kids from Pakistan to Space Camp in Alabama and Dollywood in Tennessee; $1.8 mil-lion to improve the international per-ception of Afghan artisans and crafts-man; $10,000 to improve Pakistan’s film industry. Really? U.S. taxpayer money to subsidize Pakistan’s version of Hol-lywood; a $2 million venture capital fund in Bosnia for businesses that couldn’t get their own financing; al-most $8 million for foreign dance residencies. Really? Ballet for Bolivia; more than $9 million to ease medical \\n at the age of 84. He will be remembered for his outstanding leg-acy of dedication to Connecticut as a statesman and an activist. \\nEd began his impressive career on be-\\nhalf of our country in the U.S. Army, serving for 5 years. A dedicated steel-workers’ union representative, he was first elected to the Bridgeport City \\nCouncil in 1983. Throughout his decades on the council, Ed quickly earned the respect of constituents and colleagues, alike. \\nIn 2004, Ed was elected to the Con-\\nnecticut Senate, where he served for a total of 12 years. As State senator, Ed fought tirelessly for the people of Con-necticut, always going the extra mile to help his constituents. He knew that government could instill positive change for working families and con-stantly advocated on their behalf. \\nCommitted to social reform and civil \\nrights, Ed participated in the March on Washington in 1963. His activism touched countless lives across our State and was an inspiration for all of us. Known for his passionate efforts to help others and strong principles, Ed was also respected across the aisle and warmly recognized for his positive spir-it. Those who had the chance to work with him know well his respected, straightforward style and readiness to bolster advocacy by pulling from his personal experiences. \\nI had the privilege of attending the \\nannual L’Ambiance memorial cere-mony, recognizing those workers who \\ndied in a horrific construction acci-dent, with Ed, who unstintingly con-tinued his advocacy for workplace safe-ty. There was always an opportunity to do more and raise greater awareness of issues facing Connecticut’s working families. His dedication to fighting in-justice was a model across our State, and he never hesitated to initiate change from the frontlines. I can attest firsthand to Ed’s unfailing attitude, which was equal parts joy and deter-mination. His commitment to bettering our State and loyalty to his friends and family have left a lasting, positive mark on Connecticut’s legacy. \\nMy wife Cynthia and I extend our \\ndeepest sympathies to Ed’s family dur-ing this difficult time. May their many wonderful memories of Ed provide them solace and comfort. ∑ \\nf \\nMESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT \\nA message from the President of the \\nUnited States was communicated to the Senate by Mr. Pate, one of his sec-retaries. \\nf \\nPRESIDENTIAL MESSAGE \\nREPORT OF THE VETO OF S. 906, \\nTHE DRIFTNET MODERNIZATION AND BYCATCH REDUCTION ACT— PM 63 \\nThe PRESIDING OFFICER laid be-\\nfore the Senate the following message from the President of the United States which was ordered to be printed in the R\\nECORD , spread in full upon the \\nJournal, and held at the desk: \\nTo the Senate of the United States: \\nI am returning, without my approval, \\nS. 906, the Driftnet Modernization and Bycatch Reduction Act. America’s fish-ermen have made great sacrifices to ensure that our Nation’s marine fish-eries are a sustainable economic engine for coastal communities. Under my Ad-ministration, the number of United States fish stocks subject to over-fishing is at a historic low. This achievement is the result of a trans-parent and collaborative regulatory process that is supported by regional fishery management councils. At coun-cil meetings, fishermen work with Fed-eral Government and State govern-ment representatives to meet their statutory obligations under the Mag-nuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act. \\nIn passing S. 906, the Congress has ig-\\nnored the fact that the regional fishery management process has had strong, bipartisan support since its creation. By forcing the West Coast drift gillnet fishery to use alternative gear that has not been proven to be an economically viable substitute for gillnets, the Con-gress is effectively terminating the fishery. As a result, an estimated 30 fishing vessels, all of which are oper-ated by family-owned small businesses, \\n I signed an Executive Order on Promoting American Seafood Competitiveness and Economic Growth to bolster our do-mestic seafood industry while curbing illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing abroad. On June 5, 2020, I issued a Proclamation on Modifying the Northeast Canyons and Seamounts Ma-rine National Monument to open it to commercial fishing that is conducted in accordance with the Magnuson-Ste-vens Act and other applicable laws, regulations, and requirements. And as fishermen struggled to stay on the water during the pandemic, I issued a Memorandum on Protecting the United States Lobster Industry and later made approximately $530 million available, through the U.S. Department of Agri-culture’s Seafood Trade Relief Pro-gram, to support the United States sea-food industry and fishermen affected by retaliatory tariffs from foreign gov-ernments. \\nMy Administration would support \\nprovisions of the enrolled bill, if passed separately, which would authorize fee collection in a different fishery—the Pacific Halibut fishery. This authority is needed to implement a provision of the International Pacific Halibut Com-mission Convention, to which the United States is a party. However, for the sake of American fishermen na-tionwide, I will not let the Congress circumvent the fisheries management process by effectively terminating a fishery without appropriate consulta-tion and input from fishery manage-ment councils. If this occurred, it would increase our reliance on im-ported seafood and take away the live-lihoods of hard-working Americans and their family businesses. It is my duty to return S. 906 to the Senate without my approval. \\nD\\nONALD J.

A bill to allow Senators, Sen-\\nators-elect, committees of the Senate, leadership offices, and other offices of the Senate to share employees, and for other purposes; considered and passed. \\nS. 5086 \\nBe it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-\\nresentatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, \\nSECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. \\nThis Act may be cited as the ‘‘Senate \\nShared Employee Act’’. \\nSEC. 2. ALLOWING SENATORS, COMMITTEES, \\nLEADERSHIP OFFICES, AND OTHER OFFICES OF THE SENATE TO SHARE EMPLOYEES. \\n(a) I NGENERAL .—Section 114 of the Legis-\\nlative Branch Appropriation Act, 1978 (2 U.S.C. 4576) is amended— \\n(1) by inserting ‘‘(a)’’ before ‘‘Notwith-\\nstanding’’; \\n(2) by striking ‘‘position, each of’’ and all \\nthat follows through the period at the end \\n \\n(D) respect the rule of law and the con-\\nstitutional rights of all Cameroonians, in-cluding members of the political opposition, civil society activists, and journalists; \\n(E) allow for credible, independent, and \\ntransparent investigations of all allegations of human rights abuses committed in the Northwest and Southwest regions; \\n(F) release all political prisoners and jour-\\nnalists currently detained and immediately stop all arbitrary detention, torture, forced disappearances, deaths in custody, and inhu-mane prison conditions; and \\n(G) work with United States law enforce-\\nment to thoroughly investigate and pros-ecute those responsible for the murder of Charles Wesco; \\n(5) urges the Anglophone armed separatist \\ngroups to— \\n(A) engage peacefully with government of-\\nficials to express grievances and engage in nonviolent efforts to resolve the conflict, in-cluding participation in a credible and inclu-sive dialogue, possibly involving an inde-pendent mediator; \\n(B) immediately cease human rights \\nabuses, including killings of civilians, tor-ture, kidnapping, and extortion; \\n(C) immediately end coercive and violent \\nenforcement of the school boycott in the \\n \\nWhereas, throughout his tenure, President \\nBiya has spent extended periods in Europe, pursued government policies exclusively ben-efitting the Francophone majority in Cam-eroon, and crippled many parastatals and private enterprises in the Northwest and Southwest regions, further marginalizing English-speaking Cameroonians; \\nWhereas, in October 2016, English-speaking \\nlawyers, students, and teachers in the North-west and Southwest regions of Cameroon took to the streets to peacefully protest marginalization of English-speaking Cameroonians by the Government of Cam-eroon in the legal and education systems, as exemplified by the appointment of French- speaking judges and teachers in the North-west and Southwest regions and the pub-lishing of important legislation solely in the \\nFrench language; \\nWhereas those peaceful protests by \\nEnglish-speaking lawyers, students, and teachers were met with excessive force by the police and gendarmerie of Cameroon, which led to gross human rights violations, the arrest of lawyers, teachers, and Anglophone civic leaders, and their deten-tion in the notorious Kondengui prison in Yaounde ´; \\nWhereas, amid broader protests across the \\nNorthwest and Southwest regions demanding greater autonomy from the central govern-ment of Cameroon, on October 1, 2017, the 56th anniversary of the end of British trust-eeship over Southern Cameroons, the Anglophone crisis escalated as separatist armed groups declared independence from Cameroon; \\nWhereas, in 2017, Anglophone separatist \\narmed groups responded to the repressive and violent actions of the Government of Cameroon by targeting government officials and facilities as well as civilians and tradi-tional leaders seen as sympathetic to the Government of Cameroon and brutally en-forcing ‘‘ghost town operations’’ (general strikes) and school boycotts in the North-west and Southwest regions; \\nWhereas lengthy government-imposed \\nshutdowns of the internet and social media in the Northwest and Southwest regions, to-taling 240 days between 2017 and 2018, had a devastating impact on the economies and educational institutions in the regions, un-dermined freedom of expression, prevented the free flow of information related to the conflict, and restricted the ability of local communities to interact and communicate; \\nWhereas the conflict in the Northwest and \\nSouthwest regions of Cameroon has caused considerable instability and human suf-fering, with more than 3,000 deaths linked to the conflict as of 2018, with more recent fig-ures difficult to ascertain due to lack of ac-cess to the Northwest and Southwest re-gions, and according to United Nations agen-cies, as of 2020, approximately 3,000,000 peo-ple in Cameroon are in need of humanitarian assistance, approximately 60,000 Cameroonian refugees have fled to Nigeria, and approximately 700,000 persons are inter-nally displaced; \\nWhereas numerous credible reports from \\nhuman rights monitors, including the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, have documented the excessive use of force by government security forces against Cameroonian civilians living in the Anglophone regions, including the burning of \\nvillages, the use of live ammunition against protestors, arbitrary arrest and detention, torture, sexual abuse, and killing of civil-ians, including women, children, and the el-derly; \\nWhereas the Department of State 2019 \\nCountry Report on Human Rights Practices for Cameroon documented killings of civil-ians, kidnappings, abductions, and hostage taking, beatings, attacks on health workers and media, restrictions on movements of persons and goods, and use of child soldiers by armed Anglophone separatists; \\nWhereas the United Nations Children’s \\nFund estimates that more than 855,000 chil-dren are out of school due to the conflict, and the Department of State added Cam-eroon to the Child Soldiers Prevention Act List in the 2020 Trafficking in Persons Re-port as a foreign government ‘‘identified dur-ing the previous year as having govern-mental armed forces, police, or other secu-rity forces, or government-supported armed groups that recruit or use child soldiers’’; \\nWhereas United States citizen Charles \\nWesco was shot and killed near the town of Bamenda, Cameroon, on October 30, 2018, \\n the Government of \\nSwitzerland announced that, together with the Centre for Humanitarian Dialogue, it was facilitating a dialogue between the Gov-ernment of Cameroon and armed opposition groups to support a resolution of the Anglophone crisis; \\nWhereas, in September 2019, President Biya \\nhastily announced a Major National Dia-logue, chaired by Prime Minister Ngute from September 30 to October 4, 2019, in Yaounde ´, \\n‘‘to examine the ways and means to respond to the deeply-held aspirations of the popu-lations in the Northwest and Southwest’’; \\nWhereas, though the Major National Dia-\\nlogue led to some concessions by the Govern-ment of Cameroon on broader democratiza-tion issues, such as the release of some polit-ical prisoners, including the leader of the Cameroon Renaissance Movement, Maurice Kamto, and some of his associates after nine months of detention, it failed to bring sepa-ratist groups to the table; \\nWhereas, since the Major National Dia-\\nlogue, the killing of civilians and other atrocities continue to be recorded across the Northwest and Southwest regions, including in towns and villages such as Babanki, Bamenda, Bangem, Buea, Mamfe, Muyuka, Pinyin, and Ngarbuh, and the Government of Cameroon recently has resumed its attack on the political opposition, placing Mr. Kamto under house arrest and detaining doz-ens of his supporters; \\nWhereas national and international out-\\nrage followed the massacre of at least 23 peo-ple, including 15 children and 2 pregnant women, by government security forces and allied militia on February 14, 2020, in Ngarbuh, Donga Mantung division, in the Northwest region, and a commission of in-quiry established by Cameroonian authori-ties ultimately led to the arrest and charg-ing of 3 soldiers for murder; \\nWhereas, on June 5, 2020, amidst increasing \\nconcern over attacks on freedom of the press and detention of journalists on politically motivated charges in recent years, Cameroon authorities confirmed that an Anglophone journalist covering the conflict, Samuel Ajiekah Abuwe, known as Wazizi, who was arrested in August 2019 and transferred to a military facility, died in custody shortly after his arrest, an acknowledgment that led \\nto widespread condemnation and calls for an independent inquiry; \\nWhereas the Rapid Intervention Battalion \\n(BIR) of the Government of Cameroon, which has been accused of torture and extrajudicial killings and implicated in massacres like that of February 14, 2020, has received train-ing and support from the United States, po-tentially in contravention of legal require-ments that ‘‘no assistance shall be furnished . . . to any unit of the security forces of a foreign country if the Secretary of State has credible information that such unit has com-mitted a gross violation of human rights’’; \\nWhereas, in February 2019, the Department \\nof State announced that it would withhold some security assistance to Cameroon, in-cluding equipment and training, citing cred-ible allegations of human rights violations by state security forces and a lack of inves-tigation, accountability, and transparency by the Government of Cameroon in response; \\nWhereas, on December 26, 2019, the United \\nStates terminated the designation of Cam-eroon as a beneficiary under the African Growth and Opportunity Act (19 U.S.C. 3701 et seq.) because ‘‘the Government of Cam-eroon currently engages in gross violations \\nof internationally recognized human rights’’; \\nWhereas a European Parliament resolu-\\ntion, passed on April 18, 2019, urged inclusive political dialogue to resolve the Anglophone crisis, called for the conflict to be considered by the United Nations Security Council, and urged the European Union to ‘‘use the polit-ical leverage provided by development aid and other bilateral programmes to enhance the defense of human rights in Cameroon’’; \\nWhereas France maintains considerable in-\\nterests in Cameroon, including significant economic and security cooperation, but has not adequately used its influence to stem atrocities committed in the Anglophone re-gions or support stronger international ac-tion to seek resolution to the conflict; \\nWhereas the United Nations Resident and \\nHumanitarian Coordinator for Cameroon stated on January 24, 2019, that ‘‘Cameroon can no longer be a forgotten crisis; it needs to be high on our agenda’’, and, on June 22, 2020, a group of former world leaders and 5 Nobel Peace Laureates called on the United Nations Security Council and the United Na-tions Secretary-General, the African Union, the Commonwealth of Nations, and La Francophonie to ‘‘ensure that Cameroon’s Anglophone conflict is on the agenda of the forthcoming UN Security Council meeting and all UNOCA sessions before the UNSC’’; \\nWhereas, on May 13, 2019, an Arria-formula \\nmeeting on the humanitarian crisis in Cam-eroon was held for the United Nations Secu-rity Council, but a formal meeting on the situation in Cameroon has not yet been placed on the United Nations Security Coun-cil agenda; \\nWhereas, on July 1, 2020, in Resolution 2532 \\n(2020), the United Nations Security Council unanimously underlined its support of the appeal of the United Nations Secretary-Gen-eral for a global ceasefire in all conflicts as the world battles the COVID–19 pandemic; and \\nWhereas there is a significant \\nCameroonian diaspora in the United States, and Cameroon is a longstanding security partner and aid recipient of the United States, participating in the Trans-Sahara Counterterrorism Partnership (TSCTP) led by the Department of State and in United States-supported efforts to counter Boko Haram and the Islamic State–West Africa, both of which have mounted terrorist oper-ations in the Far North region of Cameroon since 2014: Now, therefore, be it \\nf \\nSENATE SHARED EMPLOYEE ACT \\nMr. BOOZMAN. Mr. President, I ask \\nunanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the immediate consider-ation of S. 5086, which was introduced earlier today. \\nThe PRESIDING OFFICER.

and \\n(G) engage in an ongoing effort to ensure \\nthat the crisis in the Anglophone regions is discussed in international fora, including the United Nations Security Council, that focus on urgent international diplomatic engage-ment and response; and \\n(7) urges members of the international \\ncommunity to— \\n(A) join in a strategic collective effort to \\npressure the Government of Cameroon and separatist armed groups, including through the use of available diplomatic and punitive tools, to immediately conclude and uphold a ceasefire, participate in an inclusive and meaningful dialogue to address the root causes of the conflict and pending griev-ances, and seek nonviolent solutions to the conflict, including by possibly involving an independent and credible international medi-ator;

Res. 684), as \\namended, was agreed to. \\nThe amendment (No. 2737), in the na-\\nture of a substitute, was agreed to as follows: \\n(Purpose: To amend the preamble) \\nStrike the preamble and insert the fol-\\nlowing: \\n \\nWhereas, throughout his tenure, President \\nBiya has spent extended periods in Europe, pursued government policies exclusively ben-efitting the Francophone majority in Cam-eroon, and crippled many parastatals and private enterprises in the Northwest and Southwest regions, further marginalizing English-speaking Cameroonians; \\nWhereas, in October 2016, English-speaking \\nlawyers, students, and teachers in the North-west and Southwest regions of Cameroon took to the streets to peacefully protest marginalization of English-speaking Cameroonians by the Government of Cam-eroon in the legal and education systems, as exemplified by the appointment of French- \\nspeaking judges and teachers in the North-west and Southwest regions and the pub-lishing of important legislation solely in the French language; \\nWhereas those peaceful protests by \\nEnglish-speaking lawyers, students, and teachers were met with excessive force by the police and gendarmerie of Cameroon, which led to gross human rights violations, the arrest of lawyers, teachers, and Anglophone civic leaders, and their deten-tion in the notorious Kondengui prison in Yaounde ´; \\nWhereas, amid broader protests across the \\nNorthwest and Southwest regions demanding greater autonomy from the central govern-ment of Cameroon, on October 1, 2017, the 56th anniversary of the end of British trust-eeship over Southern Cameroons, the Anglophone crisis escalated as separatist armed groups declared independence from Cameroon; \\nWhereas, in 2017, Anglophone separatist \\narmed groups responded to the repressive and violent actions of the Government of Cameroon by targeting government officials and facilities as well as civilians and tradi-tional leaders seen as sympathetic to the \\nGovernment of Cameroon and brutally en-forcing ‘‘ghost town operations’’ (general strikes) and school boycotts in the North-west and Southwest regions; \\nWhereas lengthy government-imposed \\nshutdowns of the internet and social media in the Northwest and Southwest regions, to-taling 240 days between 2017 and 2018, had a devastating impact on the economies and educational institutions in the regions, un-dermined freedom of expression, prevented the free flow of information related to the conflict, and restricted the ability of local communities to interact and communicate; \\nWhereas the conflict in the Northwest and \\nSouthwest regions of Cameroon has caused considerable instability and human suf-fering, with more than 3,000 deaths linked to the conflict as of 2018, with more recent fig-ures difficult to ascertain due to lack of ac-cess to the Northwest and Southwest re-gions, and according to United Nations agen-cies, as of 2020, approximately 3,000,000 peo-ple in Cameroon are in need of humanitarian assistance, approximately 60,000 Cameroonian refugees have fled to Nigeria, and approximately 700,000 persons are inter-nally displaced; \\nWhereas numerous credible reports from \\nhuman rights monitors, including the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, have documented the excessive use of force by government security forces against Cameroonian civilians living in the Anglophone regions, including the burning of villages, the use of live ammunition against protestors, arbitrary arrest and detention, torture, sexual abuse, and killing of civil-ians, including women, children, and the el-derly; \\nWhereas the Department of State 2019 \\nCountry Report on Human Rights Practices for Cameroon documented killings of civil-ians, kidnappings, abductions, and hostage taking, beatings, attacks on health workers and media, restrictions on movements of persons and goods, and use of child soldiers by armed Anglophone separatists; \\nWhereas the United Nations Children’s \\nFund estimates that more than 855,000 chil-dren are out of school due to the conflict, and the Department of State added Cam-eroon to the Child Soldiers Prevention Act List in the 2020 Trafficking in Persons Re-port as a foreign government ‘‘identified dur-ing the previous year as having govern-mental armed forces, police, or other secu-rity forces, or government-supported armed groups that recruit or use child soldiers’’; \\nWhereas United States citizen Charles \\nWesco was shot and killed near the town of Bamenda, Cameroon, on October 30, 2018, and, in November 2018, the Department of State stated, ‘‘In memory of American mis-sionary Charles Wesco and all others who have lost their lives in the Anglophone Cri-sis, we urge all sides to end the violence and enter into broad-based reconciliatory dia-logue without preconditions.’’; \\nWhereas, in June 2019, the Government of \\nSwitzerland announced that, together with the Centre for Humanitarian Dialogue, it was facilitating a dialogue between the Gov-ernment of Cameroon and armed opposition groups to support a resolution of the Anglophone crisis; \\nWhereas, in September 2019, President Biya \\nhastily announced a Major National Dia-logue, chaired by Prime Minister Ngute from September 30 to October 4, 2019, in Yaounde ´, \\n‘‘to examine the ways and means to respond to the deeply-held aspirations of the popu-lations in the Northwest and Southwest’’; \\nWhereas, though the Major National Dia-\\nlogue led to some concessions by the Govern-ment of Cameroon on broader democratiza-tion issues, such as the release of some polit-ical prisoners, including the leader of the \\nCameroon Renaissance Movement, Maurice Kamto, and some of his associates after nine months of detention, it failed to bring sepa-ratist groups to the table; \\nWhereas, since the Major National Dia-\\nlogue, the killing of civilians and other atrocities continue to be recorded across the Northwest and Southwest regions, including in towns and villages such as Babanki, Bamenda, Bangem, Buea, Mamfe, Muyuka, Pinyin, and Ngarbuh, and the Government of Cameroon recently has resumed its attack on the political opposition, placing Mr. Kamto under house arrest and detaining doz-ens of his supporters; \\nWhereas national and international out-\\nrage followed the massacre of at least 23 peo-ple, including 15 children and 2 pregnant women, by government security forces and allied militia on February 14, 2020, in Ngarbuh, Donga Mantung division, in the Northwest region, and a commission of in-quiry established by Cameroonian authori-ties ultimately led to the arrest and charg-ing of 3 soldiers for murder; \\nWhereas, on June 5, 2020, amidst increasing \\nconcern over attacks on freedom of the press and detention of journalists on politically motivated charges in recent years, Cameroon authorities confirmed that an Anglophone journalist covering the conflict, Samuel Ajiekah Abuwe, known as Wazizi, who was arrested in August 2019 and transferred to a military facility, died in custody shortly after his arrest, an acknowledgment that led to widespread condemnation and calls for an independent inquiry; \\nWhereas the Rapid Intervention Battalion \\n(BIR) of the Government of Cameroon, which has been accused of torture and extrajudicial killings and implicated in massacres like that of February 14, 2020, has received train-ing and support from the United States, po-tentially in contravention of legal require-ments that ‘‘no assistance shall be furnished . . . to any unit of the security forces of a foreign country if the Secretary of State has credible information that such unit has com-mitted a gross violation of human rights’’; \\nWhereas, in February 2019, the Department \\nof State announced that it would withhold some security assistance to Cameroon, in-cluding equipment and training, citing cred-ible allegations of human rights violations by state security forces and a lack of inves-tigation, accountability, and transparency by the Government of Cameroon in response; \\nWhereas, on December 26, 2019, the United \\nStates terminated the designation of Cam-eroon as a beneficiary under the African \\nGrowth and Opportunity Act (19 U.S.C. 3701 et seq.) because ‘‘the Government of Cam-eroon currently engages in gross violations of internationally recognized human rights’’; \\nWhereas a European Parliament resolu-\\ntion, passed on April 18, 2019, urged inclusive political dialogue to resolve the Anglophone crisis, called for the conflict to be considered by the United Nations Security Council, and urged the European Union to ‘‘use the polit-ical leverage provided by development aid and other bilateral programmes to enhance the defense of human rights in Cameroon’’; \\nWhereas France maintains considerable in-\\nterests in Cameroon, including significant economic and security cooperation, but has not adequately used its influence to stem atrocities committed in the Anglophone re-gions or support stronger international ac-tion to seek resolution to the conflict; \\nWhereas the United Nations Resident and \\nHumanitarian Coordinator for Cameroon stated on January 24, 2019, that ‘‘Cameroon can no longer be a forgotten crisis; it needs to be high on our agenda’’, and, on June 22, 2020, a group of former world leaders and 5 Nobel Peace Laureates called on the United \\n an Arria-formula \\nmeeting on the humanitarian crisis in Cam-eroon was held for the United Nations Secu-rity Council, but a formal meeting on the situation in Cameroon has not yet been placed on the United Nations Security Coun-cil agenda; \\nWhereas, on July 1, 2020, in Resolution 2532 \\n(2020), the United Nations Security Council unanimously underlined its support of the appeal of the United Nations Secretary-Gen-eral for a global ceasefire in all conflicts as the world battles the COVID–19 pandemic; and \\nWhereas there is a significant \\nCameroonian diaspora in the United States, \\nand Cameroon is a longstanding security partner and aid recipient of the United States, participating in the Trans-Sahara Counterterrorism Partnership (TSCTP) led by the Department of State and in United States-supported efforts to counter Boko Haram and the Islamic State–West Africa, both of which have mounted terrorist oper-ations in the Far North region of Cameroon since 2014: Now, therefore, be it \\nThe preamble, as amended, was \\nagreed to. \\nS. R ES. 684 \\nWhereas Cameroon is beset with multiple \\nsecurity challenges, including a Boko Haram insurgency in the Far North region, cross- border conflict and criminality by Central African militia groups to the east, and a civil war involving the Government of Cam-eroon and Anglophone separatist armed groups in the Northwest and Southwest re-gions; \\nWhereas the official actions and policies of \\nthe Francophone-dominated Government of Cameroon have repressed English-speaking Cameroonians politically and economically throughout the history of Cameroon, dating back to the reunification of British-adminis-tered Southern Cameroons and French Cameroun under a federal system in October 1961; \\nWhereas, in June 1972, following a national \\nreferendum, a new constitution was adopted that abolished the federal system, changed the name of the country from the Federal Republic of Cameroon to the United Republic of Cameroon, and gave additional powers to the presidency; \\nWhereas Paul Biya, the oldest head of \\nstate in Africa, has been the President of Cameroon since 1982, maintaining his grip on power by centralizing authority in the exec-utive, undermining the Constitution of Cam-eroon, impeding democratic governance through corrupt practices, using security services to repress the opposition, and con-ducting elections marred by widespread irregularities and allegations of fraud; \\nWhereas key decentralization reforms en-\\nacted in the Constitution of Cameroon in 1996, which mandated the establishment of a decentralized unitary state, ‘‘equality of all citizens before the law’’, the equal status of French and English as official languages, and the establishment of local authorities with ‘‘administrative and financial autonomy’’, remain largely unrealized, though an ena-bling law was adopted in December 2019; \\nWhereas, throughout his tenure, President \\nBiya has spent extended periods in Europe, pursued government policies exclusively ben-efitting the Francophone majority in Cam-eroon, and crippled many parastatals and private enterprises in the Northwest and Southwest regions, further marginalizing \\nEnglish-speaking Cameroonians; \\nWhereas, in October 2016, English-speaking \\nlawyers, students, and teachers in the North-west and Southwest regions of Cameroon took to the streets to peacefully protest marginalization of English-speaking Cameroonians by the Government of Cam-eroon in the legal and education systems, as exemplified by the appointment of French- speaking judges and teachers in the North-west and Southwest regions and the pub-lishing of important legislation solely in the French language; \\nWhereas those peaceful protests by \\nEnglish-speaking lawyers, students, and teachers were met with excessive force by the police and gendarmerie of Cameroon, which led to gross human rights violations, the arrest of lawyers, teachers, and Anglophone civic leaders, and their deten-tion in the notorious Kondengui prison in Yaounde ´; \\nWhereas, amid broader protests across the \\nNorthwest and Southwest regions demanding greater autonomy from the central govern-ment of Cameroon, on October 1, 2017, the 56th anniversary of the end of British trust-eeship over Southern Cameroons, the Anglophone crisis escalated as separatist armed groups declared independence from Cameroon; \\nWhereas, in 2017, Anglophone separatist \\narmed groups responded to the repressive and violent actions of the Government of Cameroon by targeting government officials and facilities as well as civilians and tradi-tional leaders seen as sympathetic to the Government of Cameroon and brutally en-forcing ‘‘ghost town operations’’ (general strikes) and school boycotts in the North-west and Southwest regions; \\nWhereas lengthy government-imposed \\nshutdowns of the internet and social media in the Northwest and Southwest regions, to-taling 240 days between 2017 and 2018, had a devastating impact on the economies and educational institutions in the regions, un-dermined freedom of expression, prevented the free flow of information related to the conflict, and restricted the ability of local communities to interact and communicate; \\nWhereas the conflict in the Northwest and \\nSouthwest regions of Cameroon has caused considerable instability and human suf-fering, with more than 3,000 deaths linked to the conflict as of 2018, with more recent fig-ures difficult to ascertain due to lack of ac-cess to the Northwest and Southwest re-gions, and according to United Nations agen-cies, as of 2020, approximately 3,000,000 peo-\\nple in Cameroon are in need of humanitarian assistance, approximately 60,000 Cameroonian refugees have fled to Nigeria, and approximately 700,000 persons are inter-nally displaced; \\nWhereas numerous credible reports from \\nhuman rights monitors, including the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, have documented the excessive use of force by government security forces against Cameroonian civilians living in the Anglophone regions, including the burning of villages, the use of live ammunition against protestors, arbitrary arrest and detention, torture, sexual abuse, and killing of civil-ians, including women, children, and the el-derly; \\nWhereas the Department of State 2019 \\nCountry Report on Human Rights Practices for Cameroon documented killings of civil-ians, kidnappings, abductions, and hostage taking, beatings, attacks on health workers and media, restrictions on movements of persons and goods, and use of child soldiers by armed Anglophone separatists; \\nWhereas the United Nations Children’s \\nFund estimates that more than 855,000 chil-dren are out of school due to the conflict, \\nand the Department of State added Cam-eroon to the Child Soldiers Prevention Act List in the 2020 Trafficking in Persons Re-port as a foreign government ‘‘identified dur-ing the previous year as having govern-mental armed forces, police, or other secu-rity forces, or government-supported armed groups that recruit or use child soldiers’’; \\nWhereas United States citizen Charles \\nWesco was shot and killed near the town of Bamenda, Cameroon, on October 30, 2018, and, in November 2018, the Department of State stated, ‘‘In memory of American mis-sionary Charles Wesco and all others who have lost their lives in the Anglophone Cri-sis, we urge all sides to end the violence and enter into broad-based reconciliatory dia-logue without preconditions.’’; \\nWhereas, in June 2019, the Government of \\nSwitzerland announced that, together with \\nthe Centre for Humanitarian Dialogue, it was facilitating a dialogue between the Gov-ernment of Cameroon and armed opposition groups to support a resolution of the Anglophone crisis; \\nWhereas, in September 2019, President Biya \\nhastily announced a Major National Dia-logue, chaired by Prime Minister Ngute from September 30 to October 4, 2019, in Yaounde ´, \\n‘‘to examine the ways and means to respond to the deeply-held aspirations of the popu-lations in the Northwest and Southwest’’; \\nWhereas, though the Major National Dia-\\nlogue led to some concessions by the Govern-ment of Cameroon on broader democratiza-tion issues, such as the release of some polit-ical prisoners, including the leader of the Cameroon Renaissance Movement, Maurice Kamto, and some of his associates after nine months of detention, it failed to bring sepa-ratist groups to the table; \\nWhereas, since the Major National Dia-\\nlogue, the killing of civilians and other atrocities continue to be recorded across the Northwest and Southwest regions, including in towns and villages such as Babanki, Bamenda, Bangem, Buea, Mamfe, Muyuka, Pinyin, and Ngarbuh, and the Government of Cameroon recently has resumed its attack on the political opposition, placing Mr. Kamto under house arrest and detaining doz-ens of his supporters; \\nWhereas national and international out-\\nrage followed the massacre of at least 23 peo-ple, including 15 children and 2 pregnant women, by government security forces and allied militia on February 14, 2020, in Ngarbuh, Donga Mantung division, in the Northwest region, and a commission of in-quiry established by Cameroonian authori-ties ultimately led to the arrest and charg-ing of 3 soldiers for murder; \\nWhereas, on June 5, 2020, amidst increasing \\nconcern over attacks on freedom of the press and detention of journalists on politically motivated charges in recent years, Cameroon authorities confirmed that an Anglophone journalist covering the conflict, Samuel Ajiekah Abuwe, known as Wazizi, who was arrested in August 2019 and transferred to a military facility, died in custody shortly after his arrest, an acknowledgment that led to widespread condemnation and calls for an independent inquiry; \\nWhereas the Rapid Intervention Battalion \\n(BIR) of the Government of Cameroon, which has been accused of torture and extrajudicial killings and implicated in massacres like that of February 14, 2020, has received train-ing and support from the United States, po-tentially in contravention of legal require-ments that ‘‘no assistance shall be furnished . . . to any unit of the security forces of a foreign country if the Secretary of State has credible information that such unit has com-mitted a gross violation of human rights’’; \\n the Department \\nof State announced that it would withhold some security assistance to Cameroon, in-cluding equipment and training, citing cred-ible allegations of human rights violations by state security forces and a lack of inves-tigation, accountability, and transparency by the Government of Cameroon in response; \\nWhereas, on December 26, 2019, the United \\nStates terminated the designation of Cam-eroon as a beneficiary under the African Growth and Opportunity Act (19 U.S.C. 3701 et seq.) because ‘‘the Government of Cam-eroon currently engages in gross violations of internationally recognized human rights’’; \\nWhereas a European Parliament resolu-\\ntion, passed on April 18, 2019, urged inclusive political dialogue to resolve the Anglophone crisis, called for the conflict to be considered by the United Nations Security Council, and urged the European Union to ‘‘use the polit-ical leverage provided by development aid and other bilateral programmes to enhance the defense of human rights in Cameroon’’; \\nWhereas France maintains considerable in-\\nterests in Cameroon, including significant economic and security cooperation, but has not adequately used its influence to stem atrocities committed in the Anglophone re-gions or support stronger international ac-tion to seek resolution to the conflict; \\nWhereas the United Nations Resident and \\nHumanitarian Coordinator for Cameroon stated on January 24, 2019, that ‘‘Cameroon can no longer be a forgotten crisis; it needs to be high on our agenda’’, and, on June 22, 2020, a group of former world leaders and 5 Nobel Peace Laureates called on the United Nations Security Council and the United Na-tions Secretary-General, the African Union, the Commonwealth of Nations, and La Francophonie to ‘‘ensure that Cameroon’s Anglophone conflict is on the agenda of the forthcoming UN Security Council meeting and all UNOCA sessions before the UNSC’’; \\nWhereas, on May 13, 2019, an Arria-formula \\nmeeting on the humanitarian crisis in Cam-eroon was held for the United Nations Secu-rity Council, but a formal meeting on the situation in Cameroon has not yet been placed on the United Nations Security Coun-cil agenda; \\nWhereas, on July 1, 2020, in Resolution 2532 \\n(2020), the United Nations Security Council unanimously underlined its support of the appeal of the United Nations Secretary-Gen-eral for a global ceasefire in all conflicts as the world battles the COVID–19 pandemic; and \\nWhereas there is a significant \\nCameroonian diaspora in the United States, and Cameroon is a longstanding security partner and aid recipient of the United States, participating in the Trans-Sahara Counterterrorism Partnership (TSCTP) led by the Department of State and in United States-supported efforts to counter Boko Haram and the Islamic State–West Africa, both of which have mounted terrorist oper-\\nations in the Far North region of Cameroon since 2014: Now, therefore, be it \\nResolved, That the Senate— \\n(1) strongly condemns abuses committed \\nby state security forces and armed groups in the Northwest and Southwest regions of Cameroon, including extrajudicial killings and detentions, the use of force against civil-ians and nonviolent protestors, torture, rape, kidnappings, and other forms of violence against women, and violations of the free-doms of press, expression, and assembly; \\n(2) urges all parties to the Anglophone con-\\nflict in Cameroon, including political opposi-tion groups, to— \\n(A) conclude and uphold an immediate \\nceasefire; (B) guarantee unfettered humanitarian ac-\\ncess and assistance to the Northwest and Southwest regions; \\n(C) exercise restraint and ensure that po-\\nlitical protests are peaceful; and \\n(D) establish a credible process for an in-\\nclusive dialogue that includes all relevant stakeholders, including from civil society, to achieve a sustainable political solution that respects the rights and freedoms of all of the people of Cameroon; \\n(3) affirms that the United States Govern-\\nment continues to hold the Government of Cameroon responsible for safeguarding the safety, security, and constitutional rights of all citizens, regardless of their region of ori-gin or the regions in which they reside, or their religious beliefs or political views; \\n(4) urges the Government of Cameroon to— (A) initiate a credible, inclusive, good-faith \\neffort to end the armed conflict in the North-west and Southwest regions of Cameroon by addressing the root causes of the crisis and grievances and seeking nonviolent solutions to resolve the conflict, including possibly in-volving an independent mediator in negotia-tions; \\n(B) follow through on initiatives developed \\nto address the grievances that sparked the conflict, including the National Commission for the Promotion of Bilingualism and Multiculturalism, the Ministry of Decen-tralization and Local Development, and the National Disarmament, Demobilization, and Reintegration Committee; \\n(C) fully implement recommendations of \\nthe Major National Dialogue held in late 2019; \\n(D) respect the rule of law and the con-\\nstitutional rights of all Cameroonians, in-cluding members of the political opposition, civil society activists, and journalists; \\n(E) allow for credible, independent, and \\ntransparent investigations of all allegations of human rights abuses committed in the Northwest and Southwest regions; \\n(F) release all political prisoners and jour-\\nnalists currently detained and immediately stop all arbitrary detention, torture, forced disappearances, deaths in custody, and inhu-mane prison conditions; and \\n(G) work with United States law enforce-\\nment to thoroughly investigate and pros-ecute those responsible for the murder of Charles Wesco; \\n(5) urges the Anglophone armed separatist \\ngroups to— \\n(A) engage peacefully with government of-\\nficials to express grievances and engage in nonviolent efforts to resolve the conflict, in-cluding participation in a credible and inclu-\\nsive dialogue, possibly involving an inde-pendent mediator; \\n(B) immediately cease human rights \\nabuses, including killings of civilians, tor-ture, kidnapping, and extortion; \\n(C) immediately end coercive and violent \\nenforcement of the school boycott in the Northwest and Southwest regions and at-tacks on schools, teachers, and education of-ficials, and allow for the peaceful and safe return of all students to class; and \\n(D) publicly condemn the illegal detention \\nand kidnapping of civilians; \\n(6) urges the Department of State, Depart-\\nment of the Treasury, and United States Agency for International Development, in coordination with other relevant Federal de-partments and agencies, to— \\n(A) consider imposing targeted sanctions \\non individual government and separatist leaders ‘‘responsible for extrajudicial killings, torture, or other gross violations of internationally recognized human rights’’; \\n(B) press the Government of Cameroon to \\nprovide unfettered humanitarian access to vulnerable populations in the Northwest and Southwest regions of Cameroon; (C) support credible efforts to address the \\nroot causes of the conflict and to achieve sustainable peace and reconciliation, pos-sibly involving an independent mediator, and efforts to aid the economic recovery of and fight coronavirus in the Northwest and Southwest regions; \\n(D) support humanitarian and development \\nprogramming, including to meet immediate needs, advance nonviolent conflict resolu-tion and reconciliation, promote economic recovery and development, support primary and secondary education, and strengthen democratic processes, including political de-centralization, enshrined as a fundamental principle of state governance in the Con-stitution of Cameroon; \\n(E) continue to limit security assistance to \\nCameroon and ensure that United States training and equipment is not being used to facilitate human rights abuses in the North-west and Southwest regions; \\n(F) prioritize efforts to help develop and \\nsustain effective, professional civilian over-sight of law enforcement and security serv-ices in Cameroon to ensure they are held ac-countable for abuses; and \\n(G) engage in an ongoing effort to ensure \\nthat the crisis in the Anglophone regions is discussed in international fora, including the United Nations Security Council, that focus on urgent international diplomatic engage-ment and response; and \\n(7) urges members of the international \\ncommunity to— \\n(A) join in a strategic collective effort to \\npressure the Government of Cameroon and separatist armed groups, including through the use of available diplomatic and punitive tools, to immediately conclude and uphold a ceasefire, participate in an inclusive and meaningful dialogue to address the root causes of the conflict and pending griev-ances, and seek nonviolent solutions to the conflict, including by possibly involving an independent and credible international medi-ator; \\n(B) mobilize and coordinate funding for \\nlocal and international organizations to pro-vide humanitarian and development assist-ance, including to fight coronavirus, to com-munities affected by the crisis in the North-west and Southwest regions of Cameroon; \\n(C) leverage bilateral relationships to en-\\ncourage key partners of Cameroon, particu-larly France, to help foster a peaceful resolu-tion to the crisis in the Northwest and Southwest regions of Cameroon, potentially with the involvement of an independent me-diator, and implement a mutually agreed- upon program to address longstanding griev-ances and marginalization; and \\n(D) use regional and international fora, in-\\ncluding the African Union, the Economic Community of Central African States, and the United Nations Security Council to— \\n(i) discuss the ongoing crisis in the North-\\nwest and Southwest regions of Cameroon; \\n(ii) push for a cessation of violence, an ex-\\npedient resolution, and the implementation of a mutually agreed-upon program for ad-dressing the root causes and pending griev-ances; and \\n(iii) maintain calls for the investigation \\nand prosecution of human rights abuses and crimes committed against civilians. \\nf \\nMALALA YOUSAFZAI \\nSCHOLARSHIP ACT \\nMr. BOOZMAN.
